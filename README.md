# **Project Overview**
A machine learning project designed to detect and classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant.
Uses a dataset with features derived from breast mass cell nuclei measurements.
Aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer efficiently.
# **Key Features**
Dataset:

Utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
Contains features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
Algorithms:

Multiple machine learning models are tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
The best-performing model is selected based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, normalization, and feature scaling.
Employs feature selection techniques to retain the most relevant features.
Evaluation Metrics:

1.Accuracy: 
Overall correctness of the model.
2.Precision:
Ability to correctly identify malignant tumors.
3.Recall:
Sensitivity to detect all malignant cases.
4.F1-Score:
Balance between precision and recall.
5.Visualization:
Includes visual tools like correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
6.Deployment:
Provides a web-based interface using Streamlit for easy model interaction.
Users can input feature values and get real-time predictions.
