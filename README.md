Project Overview
A machine learning project designed to detect and classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant.
Uses a dataset with features derived from breast mass cell nuclei measurements.
Aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer efficiently.
Key Features
Dataset:

Utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
Contains features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
Algorithms:

Multiple machine learning models are tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
The best-performing model is selected based on metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, normalization, and feature scaling.
Employs feature selection techniques to retain the most relevant features.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Ability to correctly identify malignant tumors.
Recall: Sensitivity to detect all malignant cases.
F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.
Visualization:

Includes visual tools like correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
Deployment:

Provides a web-based interface using Streamlit for easy model interaction.
Users can input feature values and get real-time predictions.
